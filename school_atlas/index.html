            <h1>Where do Viennese children continue their studies after attending a Volksschule?</h1>

            <h2>A rough analysis using the data of Statistik Austria</h2>

            <p>
              The data in the table below are taken from the report of Statistik Austria for the year <b>2022/23</b>.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
              Most of the tables and additional information from Statistik Austria are provided in the Report 
              "Schule, Schulbesuch 2022/23" at 
              <a target = _blank rel = "noopener" href = "https://www.statistik.at/statistiken/bevoelkerung-und-soziales/bildung/schulbesuch">this link</a>.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>
              In the tables in that report there are plenty of interesting data about the number of children attending 
              various types of schools, divided by Gemeinden (in Vienna: Bezirks), but I could not find any table listing 
              where children continue their studies (normally for the 5th class) after attending the various elementary schools 
              (<i>Volksschulen</i>) in Vienna. These data are instead only provided in the 
              <a target = _blank rel = "noopener" href = "https://www.statistik.at/atlas/schulen/">atlas at this link</a>, which is
              however cumbersome to use since one has to click on every individual school to get this type of information.
              The table below is generated using data from that atlas, but displaying them in a simpler form. 
              It is likely that similar analysis have been done already
              also by other people, I do not claim originality :-) and I would be happy to know about other similar attempts.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
              The next report with the data of the school year 2023/24 is expected to be published on 29.11.2024; 
              it is however not clear if the new data needed for generating the table below
              will be automatically updated in the atlas at the same time, or only in the next few weeks. 
              If I will have some time (and if the data are still available in the same format), I will update this website accordingly, 
              but I cannot promise anything at the moment.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
              Some short explanations about the table below:
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
              (1) In the atlas of Statistik Austria there are some movements of students listed as "&leq; 6"; 
              in the actual data, those movements are instead
              all equal to zero, and the atlas is manually coded in order to display "&leq; 6" in these cases, 
              even if this sounds completely useless on first view. However, comparing the number of children for each school with the number
              of "outgoing" children at the end of their 4th year, it is clear that some outgoing students are actually missing and indeed hidden
              in the zero data in the database of Statistik Austria. The most likely reason for that is a data privacy issue: providing exact
              numbers &leq; 6 for a given school means being able, at least in certain cases, to de-anonymize some data. As such, we can assume that
              Statistik Austria indeed puts to zero each data &leq; 6 in their (public) database, and then provides a hint on this using the
              manually coded "&leq; 6" information. In order to estimate what is missing, in the table below I proceeded as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>I ignored the fact that some schools may have some classes of <i>Vorschule</i>: first of all, there is no data to use in order
                to estimate whether a <i>Vorschule</i> is present or not; second of all, the classes of <i>Vorschule</i> are normally considerably less
                than the classes for the 1st year of elementary school, and sometimes even integrated as part of a normal 1st class.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>For each school separately, I assumed a constant amount of students in the various classes, 
                and of classes in the various years (= same amount of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th classes). This is not true in the case of newly created elementary schools,
                but in this scenario, we are normally not dealing with outgoing students until an entire cycle of 4 years has passed, hence the
                data of outgoing students will be zero anyway, thus this assumption should not impact significantly the final result.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>For each school separately, I assumed that all the target schools for the students "&leq; 6" attracted the same average 
                number of students: if a target school appears with the description "&leq; 6", it means that there is for sure 
                at least 1 student that went to that school and possibly up to additional 5 students obfuscated in the data. 
                As such: 1 student is considered "confirmed" for each such data.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              All the previous ones are reasonable hypotheses, but it could be that some single schools deviate from this scenario, 
              thus influencing the actual real data.
              <br>
              Given these assumptions, 
              the estimate of "missing outgoing students" is simply obtained as the difference between the expected outgoing students
              (the number of students in a given school, divided by 4) and the number of actual confirmed outgoing students 
              shown by the atlas of Statistik Austria with exact numbers (+ 1 student for each school with "&leq; 6").
              Then the estimated number of outgoing students of type "&leq; 6" in each target school 
              is simply the number of estimated missing outgoing students divided by the number of those target schools.
              <br>
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
              (2) In the table below you can see some movements of students from some <i>Volksschulen</i> back again in 
              <i>Volksschulen</i>. 
              This is the case for the <i>Wiederholung der Schulstufe im gleichen Schultyp</i> (not necessarily in the same school).
            </p>
            
            <br>

            <p>
              (3) Some schools with the exact same address appear twice in the data of Statistik Austria, hence also in the table below. 
              This is most likely due to the fact that some Viennese schools switched in the last years
              from a <i>Halbtagsmodell</i> to a <i>Ganztagsschule</i>, thus appearing as two different entities in the data of Statistik Austria.
              Some schools may appear with zero data: this is for any schools that opened less than 4 years ago, thus having no
              data for "outgoing" students after the 4th year. 
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
              (4) In very few cases you will notice that the sum of the percentages is not equal to 100%. This is due to some children switching to
              a so-called <i>Sonstigen allgemein bildende (Statut)Schule</i>, which are technically speaking neither AHS nor Neue Mittelschule.
            </p>
            <details>
              <summary style = "font-size: 18px; line-height: 36px; letter-spacing: 0; font-weight: 400;">
                Show/hide the list of <i>Sonstigen allgemein bildende (Statut)Schule</i> in Vienna
              </summary>
              <p>
                This is a list extracted from the data of Statistik Austria, but I don't claim completeness.
                You can notice that there are also a Volksschule (but it is not categorized as a Volksschule in the data of Statistik Austria)
                and schools for classes 10 to 12, which of course are not relevant for the analysis of the immediate schools after
                the 4th year of Volksschule.
