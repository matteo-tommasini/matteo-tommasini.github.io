            <h1>Where do Viennese children continue their studies after attending a Volksshule?</h1>

            <h2>A rough analysis using the data of Statistik Austria</h2>

            <p>
              The data in the table below are taken from the report of Statistik Austria for the year <b>2022/23</b>.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
              Most of the tables and additional information from Statistik Austria are provided in the Report 
              "Schule, Schulbesuch 2022/23" at 
              <a target = _blank rel = "noopener" href = "https://www.statistik.at/statistiken/bevoelkerung-und-soziales/bildung/schulbesuch">this link</a>.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>
              In the tables in that report there are plenty of interesting data about the number of children attending 
              various types of schools, divided by Gemeinden (in Vienna: Bezirks), but I could not find any table listing 
              where children continue their studies (normally for the 5th class) after attending the various elementary schools 
              (<i>Volksschulen</i>) in Vienna. These data are instead only provided in the 
              <a target = _blank rel = "noopener" href = "https://www.statistik.at/atlas/schulen/">atlas at this link</a>, which is
              however cumbersome to use since one has to click on every individual school to get this type of information.
              The table below is generated using data from that atlas, but displaying them in a simpler form. 
              It is likely that similar analysis have been done already
              also by other people, I do not claim originality :-) and I would be happy to know about other similar attempts.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
              The next report with the data of the school year 2023/24 is expected to be published on 29.11.2024; 
              it is however not clear if the new data needed for generating the table below
              will be automatically updated in the atlas at the same time, or only in the next few weeks. 
              If I will have some time (and if the data are still available in the same format), I will update this website accordingly, 
              but I cannot promise anything at the moment.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
              Some short explanations about the table below:
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
              (1) In the atlas of Statistik Austria there are some movements of students listed as "&leq; 6"; 
              in the actual data, those movements are instead
              all equal to zero, and the atlas is manually coded in order to display "&leq; 6" in these cases, 
              even if this sounds completely useless on first view. However, comparing the number of children for each school with the number
              of "outgoing" children at the end of their 4th year, it is clear that some outgoing students are actually missing and indeed hidden
              in the zero data in the database of Statistik Austria. The most probable reason for that is a data privacy issue: providing
              numbers &leq; 6 for a given school means being able, at least in certain cases, to de-anonymize some data. As such, we can assume that
              Statistik Austria indeed puts to zero each data &leq; 6 in their (public) database, and then provides a hint on this using the
              manually coded "&leq; 6" information. In order to estimate what is missing, in the table below I proceeded as follows:
              <br>
              (a) I ignored the fact that some schools may have some classes of <i>Vorschule</i>: first of all, there is no data to use in order
              to estimate whether a <i>Vorschule</i> is present or not; second of all, the classes of <i>Vorschule</i> are normally considerably less
              than the classes for the 1st year of elementary school, and sometimes even integrated as part of a normal 1st class
              <br>
              (b) In each school separately I assumed a constant amount of students in the various classes, 
              and of classes in the various years (= same amount of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th classes). This is not true in the case of newly created elementary schools,
              but in this scenario, we are normally not dealing with outgoing students until an entire cycle of 4 years has passed.
              <br>
              (c) I assumed that all the target schools for the students "&leq; 6" all attracted the same average number of students 
              for trusting the actual source of data and not their visual representation in the atlas: all these cases are treated as zero.
              <br>
              All the previous ones are reasonable hypotheses, but it could be that some single schools deviate from this scenario, thus influencing the actual real data.
              <br>
              Given these assumptions, 
              the estimate of "missing outgoing students" is simply obtained as the difference between the expected outgoing students
              (the number of students in a given school, divided by  4) and the number of actual outgoing students shown by the atlas of Statistik Austria with exact numbers.
              Then the estimated number of outgoing students of type "&leq; 6" in each target school is simply the number of estimated missing outgoing students
              divided by the number of those target schools.
              <br>
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
              (2) In the table below you can see some movements of students from some <i>Volksshulen</i> back again in 
              <i>Volksschulen</i>. 
              This is the case for the <i>Wiederholung der Schulstufe im gleichen Schultyp</i> (not necessarily in the same school).
            </p>
            
            <br>

            <p>
              (3) Some schools with the exact same address appear twice in the data of Statistik Austria, hence also in the table below. 
              This is most likely due to the fact that some Viennese schools switched in the last years
              from a Halbtagsmodell to a Ganztagsschule, thus appearing as two different entities in the data of Statistik Austria.
            </p>

            <br>
  
            <p>
              (4) The next table displays correctly only on a medium/large screen: either use your mobile phone in horizontal mode, 
              or switch to a computer/tablet.
