            <h1>Where do Viennese children continue their studies after attending a Volksshule?</h1>

            <h2>A rough analysis using the data of Statistik Austria</h2>

            <p>
              The data in the table below are taken from the report of Statistik Austria for the year <b>2022/23</b>.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
              Most of the tables and additional information from Statistik Austria are provided in the Report 
              "Schule, Schulbesuch 2022/23" at 
              <a target = _blank rel = "noopener" href = "https://www.statistik.at/statistiken/bevoelkerung-und-soziales/bildung/schulbesuch">this link</a>.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>
              In the tables in that report there are plenty of interesting data about the number of children attending 
              various types of schools, divided by Gemeinden (in Vienna: Bezirks), but I could not find any table listing 
              where children continue their studies (normally for the 5th class) after attending the various elementary schools 
              (<i>Volksschulen</i>) in Vienna. These data are instead only provided in the 
              <a target = _blank rel = "noopener" href = "https://www.statistik.at/atlas/schulen/">atlas at this link</a>, which is
              however cumbersome to use since one has to click on every individual school to get this type of information.
              The table below is generated using data from that atlas, but displaying them in a simpler form. 
              It is likely that similar analysis have been done already
              also by other people, I do not claim originality :-) and I would be happy to know about other similar attempts.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
              The next report with the data of the school year 2023/24 is expected to be published on 29.11.2024; 
              it is however not clear if the new data needed for generating the table below
              will be automatically updated in the atlas at the same time, or only in the next few weeks. 
              If I will have some time (and if the data are still available in the same format), I will update this website accordingly, 
              but I cannot promise anything at the moment.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
              Some short explanations about the table below:
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
              (1) In the atlas of Statistik Austria there are some movements of students listed as "&leq; 6"; 
              in the actual data those movements are instead
              all equal to zero, and the atlas is manually coded in order to display "&leq; 6" in these cases, 
              even if this sounds completely useless. For this reason, I opted
              for trusting the actual source of data and not their visual representation in the atlas: all these cases are treated as zero.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
              (2) In the table below you can see some movements of students from some <i>Volksshulen</i> back again in 
              <i>Volksschulen</i>. 
              This is the case for the <i>Wiederholung der Schulstufe im gleichen Schultyp</i> (not necessarily in the same school).
            </p>
            
            <br>

            <p>
              (3) Some schools with the exact same address appear twice in the data of Statistik Austria, hence also in the table below. 
              This is most likely due to the fact that some Viennese schools switched in the last years
              from a Halbtagsmodell to a Ganztagsschule, thus appearing as two different entities in the data of Statistik Austria.
            </p>

            <br>
  
            <p>
              (4) The next table displays correctly only on a medium/large screen: either use your mobile phone in horizontal mode, 
              or switch to a computer/tablet.
